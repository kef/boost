Current:
  * Prefer arrays over Lists whereever possible.  Restrict List usage to inside methods.
  * If you want to build up a parallel replacement, rename the current class to Old
    something (ie. DefaultEater becomes OldEater).
  * If you come across and Old* class which is not yours, work with the person/pair
    who modified it.  Integration is more important than your card.

Proposed:

Old:
