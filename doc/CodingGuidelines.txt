Current:
  * Prefer arrays over Lists whereever possible.  Restrict List usage to inside methods.
  * If you want to build up a parallel replacement, rename the current class to Old
    something (ie. DefaultEater becomes OldEater).
  * If you come across and Old* class which is not yours, work with the person/pair
    who modified it.  Integration is more important than your card.
  * Do not loosen checks without consulting the group.
  * No copy and paste, cut and paste and paste or inlining to achieve equivalent.
  * Copy and paste is ok for single token.  If in doubt as to single token do not copy and paste.
