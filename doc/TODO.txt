March 2008:

 * Get coverage up to 100% with cobertura 1.9.
 * Review possibilities for generics.
 * Tidy up layers in spider.
 * Remove ALL nursery dodginess, except things truly in spike mode.
 * Implement more substantial demo tests.
 * Introduction to "boost" document.
 * Examples document.
 * Split into separate components.
 * Introduce versioning.  Draw a line in the sand and ship.

March 2006:

Just some rough ideas we might use in Boost -- Mr O'Keeffe (circa 2006).

 * InstanceProvider - construction vs resolution implementations, see IOC resolve() in easydoc.
 * How do we boostrap instance of InstanceProvider itself? Construct just that one in Primordial or provide a global way of accessing it.
 * FactoryTestUtil depends on InstanceProvider.
 * NullArgsTestChecker.
 * OO support.
 * Rename ImmutableTestUtil --> Checker.
 * Compare against what we have done on other projects - particularly usability improvements of test utilities.
 * Remove duplication detected by IntelliJ.
 * Refocus scope - Primordial plus utilities for test driving.
   * Change description at geekscape.org !
 * Decide on mocking style - handcrafted vs JMock vs EasyMock vs RMock.
   * Update dev mail list and ask for opinions on this.
 * Split boundaries for testability (final, static) from checked exception wrappers.
 * Dynamic checked exception wrapper proxy.
 * Boundaries themselves may be able to be generated, possibly dynamically.
 * Compare and contrast with testing utilities in JUnit Addons, particularly for testing Primordial stuff.
