Just some rough ideas we might use in Boost -- Mr O'Keeffe.

 * InstanceProvider - construction vs resolution implementations, see IOC resolve() in easydoc.
 * How do we boostrap instance of InstanceProvider itself? Construct just that one in Primordial or provide a global way of accessing it.
 * FactoryTestUtil depends on InstanceProvider.
 * NullArgsTestChecker.
 * OO support.
 * Rename ImmutableTestUtil --> Checker.
 * Compare against what we have done on other projects - particularly usability improvements of test utilities.
 * Remove duplication detected by IntelliJ.
 * Refocus scope - Primordial plus utilities for test driving.
   * Fix description at geekscape.org.
 * Decide on mocking style - handcrafted vs JMock vs EasyMock vs RMock.
   * Update dev mail list and ask for opinions on this.
 * Split boundaries for testability (final, static) from checked exception wrappers.
 * Dynamic checked exception wrapper proxy.
 * Boundaries themselves may be able to be generated, possibly dynamically.
 * Compare and contrast with testing utilities in JUnit Addons, particularly for testing Primordial stuff.
