    Edge classes are very thin. There are written to achieve the following:
    <ul>
        <li>Wrap the JDK APIs in interfaces.</li>
        <li>Map any checked exceptions to unchecked exceptions.</li>
    </ul>
    Any logic inside edge classes is frowned upon. We experimented with mapping every checked
    exception to an equivalent unchecked exception but analysis of handling has indicated wrapping
    every checked exception in a single runtime edge exception.
</p>
<p>
    Current design decisions:
    <ul>
        <li>We do not perform any null checking.</li>
        <li>All classes are final.</li>
        <li>All checked exceptions are mapped to an EdgeException.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    Outstanding questions/issues include:
    <ul>
        <li>What sort of Primordial object should edge implementations extend?</li>
    </ul>
</p>
