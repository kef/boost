Collection of design meeting bullets.  Not locked in stone but change
them when they change (if possible).  This file will probably go
when the card is completed.

 - <ClassName>Static to be used for all static methods on a class.
 - Enforce package match between edge/real.
     - done:
         - enforces <prefix>.<real package>.<real class>, eg. edge.java.lang.Class
         - does not enforce the value of prefix do we want to do this? a system wide setting perhaps
 - Decide which classes we do not edge.
     - some thoughts:
        - if it is already behind an interface and throws unchecked exceptions should it be left? e.g. collections
        - integral types (String,Integer,Double,Byte...) they don't throw checked exceptions and should be used fairly sparingly anyway
